# drs_ui_kit
创建此库的目的是，common_lib里面太多绑定了，关联的太多了，不好拆分，所以创建此库，
此库的目的是专属与ui组件，不关心任何的业务逻辑，只关心ui组件的实现，
这是一个项目专属的ui库，以后会慢慢把common_lib里面的一些widget转移到此库中.ehs.drs项目通用此ui组件.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter
[plug-in package](https://flutter.dev/developing-packages/),
a specialized package that includes platform-specific implementation code for
Android and/or iOS.

For help getting started with Flutter development, view the
[online documentation](https://flutter.dev/docs), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.

The plugin project was generated without specifying the `--platforms` flag, no platforms are currently supported.
To add platforms, run `flutter create -t plugin --platforms <platforms> .` in this directory.
You can also find a detailed instruction on how to add platforms in the `pubspec.yaml` at https://flutter.dev/docs/development/packages-and-plugins/developing-packages#plugin-platforms.
